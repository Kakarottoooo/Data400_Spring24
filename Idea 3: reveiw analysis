# Data Analysis Plan for Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Customer Reviews

## Background

E-commerce giants like Amazon employ sophisticated recommendation systems to enhance customer experience. Amazon utilizes an item-item collaborative filtering approach, capable of handling vast datasets and generating high-quality recommendations in real-time. This system predicts user preferences and "ratings" by filtering information based on item similarities.

## Project Overview

This project aims to scrape and analyze customer reviews from Amazon to perform sentiment analysis. By determining the polarity scores of reviews, we will classify the sentiments as positive, neutral, or negative. This analysis will help uncover relationships between the sentiment of reviews and the ratings given by customers. Further, we will identify frequently mentioned words in reviews that correlate with positive or negative sentiments, providing actionable insights for business improvements across different industries.

## 1. Tractable Data 

**Objective:** Ensure the data collected is relevant, manageable, and suitable for achieving the project goals.

**Action Steps:**
- Focus specifically on Amazon reviews, ensuring a representative sample across various product categories.
- Establish a structured data format (e.g., JSON, CSV) that includes necessary fields such as review text, star rating, date of review, and product category.

## 2. Data Retrieval 

**Objective:** Efficiently and ethically retrieve data without violating platform terms of service.

**Action Steps:**
- Ensure adherence to Amazon's data use policies.
- Develop a scraping tool that efficiently handles large volumes of data while respecting privacy and legal constraints.
- Implement error handling to manage data retrieval issues like network problems or changes in the website structure.
- Set up a database to store retrieved data, ensuring data integrity and ease of access for subsequent analysis.

## 3. Correct Specification of the Model 

**Objective:** Select and configure the appropriate NLP and sentiment analysis models to accurately interpret the sentiment of review texts.

**Action Steps:**
- Choose a sentiment analysis tool, such as TextBlob, and consider integrating more sophisticated NLP models if necessary (e.g., BERT, GPT).
- Pre-process the text data (tokenization, normalization, removal of stop words) to prepare it for analysis.
- Determine the methodology to calculate polarity scores and classify reviews into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.
- Validate the model with a subset of data and adjust parameters to improve accuracy.

## 4. Implications for Stakeholders 

**Objective:** Understand and communicate the potential impacts of the analysis on stakeholders including businesses, customers, and platforms.

**Action Steps:**
- Analyze how sentiment scores correlate with business ratings and identify trends or outliers.
- Prepare reports or dashboards that summarize findings in an accessible format for business owners.
- Discuss how businesses can use insights from the data to improve customer satisfaction and service quality.
- Engage with stakeholders through presentations or workshops to demonstrate the value of sentiment analysis in understanding customer feedback.

## 5. Ethical, Legal, and Societal Implications

**Objective:** Address ethical concerns and legal compliance related to data privacy and the use of AI technologies.

**Action Steps:**
- Ensure all data handling practices comply with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- Consider the ethical implications of scraping user-generated content and how it is analyzed and presented.
- Maintain transparency about the use of AI models and the potential biases in data or algorithms.
- Develop guidelines for ethical use of the analysis results, avoiding misuse or misinterpretation of the data.
