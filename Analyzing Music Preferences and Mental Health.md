# Analyzing the Correlation between Music Preferences and Mental Health Outcomes: Insights from the MxMH Dataset

## Introduction and Background
- **Objective**: To investigate the correlation between individuals' music tastes and their self-reported mental health, utilizing the MxMH dataset.
- **Significance**: This study aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of Music Therapy (MT) in managing stress, mood, and overall mental health. It could potentially inform more targeted MT interventions.

## Literature Review
- Summarize existing research on Music Therapy and its impact on mental health.
- Discuss previous findings on the relationship between music preferences and psychological well-being.

## Research Questions
- What correlations exist between music genre preferences and self-reported levels of Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, and OCD?
- How do these correlations vary across different demographics (age, location, etc.)?

## Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Describe the MxMH dataset, including how data was collected via Google Forms and distributed through various online and offline platforms.
- **Data Structure**:
    - *Block 0*: Background information on respondentsâ€™ musical background and listening habits.
    - *Block 1*: Frequency of listening to 16 different music genres.
    - *Block 2*: Self-reported mental health states (Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, OCD) on a scale of 0 to 10.
- **Statistical Methods**: Outline the statistical techniques to be used for analysis (e.g., correlation analysis, regression models, factor analysis).
- **Software and Tools**: Mention the software and tools that will be used for data analysis (e.g., Python, R, SPSS).

## Limitations
- Recognize potential biases in the dataset, including the method of data collection and the self-reported nature of mental health conditions.
- Discuss the limitations of correlational studies in implying causation.

## Conclusion
- Summarize the anticipated contributions of this research to the field of Music Therapy and mental health.

## References
